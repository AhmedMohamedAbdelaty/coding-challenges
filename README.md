# My Solutions to Coding Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to the coding challenges available at [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro). I am using this platform to learn and improve my coding skills in Java and JavaScript. I am still learning, so the solutions might not be perfect, but I am open to feedback and better solutions.
